Take your puppy outside frequently, especially after meals, naps, and playtime. Recognize signs that your puppy needs to go, such as sniffing around or circling. Positive reinforcement is essentialâ€”praise and reward your puppy with treats when they do their business outside. Accidents will happen, so be patient and never punish your puppy for them. Instead, clean up accidents thoroughly to remove any lingering scent. Crate training can also be a helpful tool, as it leverages a dog's natural instinct to keep their sleeping area clean. Remember, consistency and patience are your best friends in this process."

Start with 'sit' by holding a treat close to your puppy's nose, then moving your hand up, causing them to sit naturally. Once they sit, say 'sit' and give them the treat. For 'stay,' have your puppy sit, then open your palm in front of them and say 'stay.' Take a few steps back, and if they stay, reward them. 'Come' can be taught by crouching down and saying 'come' while gently pulling on their leash. Reward them when they reach you. 'Leave it' involves showing your puppy a treat in your hand, saying 'leave it,' and waiting until they lose interest before giving them a different treat. Consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement with treats and praise will help solidify these commands and strengthen your bond with your furry friend."

This helps them become well-adjusted and reduces the likelihood of behavioral issues. Safe and stimulating playtime activities are also essential for their physical and mental well-being. Engage in games like fetch, tug-of-war, and puzzle toys to keep your puppy entertained and active. Puppy classes and playdates are excellent opportunities for socialization and learning. These interactions help build social skills and confidence, ensuring your puppy grows into a happy and well-behaved dog."
